# DirectX-CPP-Game
In this repository, you'll find a Direct-X framework which is originally created by CERobertson / Chili-DirectX-Framework.Since I had submitted this as my second semester project so I have made few changes in it as required and then made a very simple 3D PAC-Man game with the help of tutorials available on youtube. With this framework you can make awesome games and applications. All you need is good Ideas and Creativity, rest the help is easily available on internet.
Happy Coding!
